# Cakewalk

**A/B testing? Piece of cake.**

Cakewalk is a no-code A/B testing and experimentation platform designed for startups, marketers, product managers, and indie developers who want fast feedback without writing any code. Think **Mixpanel meets Canva** for A/B tests: visual, intuitive, and delightfully simple.

## Features

- **No-Code Visual Editor** – Modify copy, buttons, layouts, or flows directly in your live site or app with a point-and-click interface.
- **Instant Variant Generator** – Describe a change and let the AI create multiple smart variations for you.
- **Smart Segments** – Automatically target users by behavior, geography, or past interactions for more meaningful tests.
- **Auto-Optimize Mode** – Automatically promote top-performing variants in real time.
- **Storytelling Reports** – Insight summaries written in plain English so everyone on the team can understand results.
- **Integrations** – Works with Webflow, Shopify, WordPress, React, and mobile apps through a lightweight SDK.

## Ideal Use Cases

- Founders testing value propositions on landing pages
- Marketers iterating on CTAs or pricing layouts
- Designers refining UX flows without dev bottlenecks
- Growth teams validating onboarding flows or upgrade nudges

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** for an account and install the Cakewalk SDK on your site or app.
2. **Create a new experiment** in the dashboard and use the visual editor to define variants.
3. **Launch** the test and monitor results in real time.
4. **Enable Auto-Optimize** to automatically promote the winning variation once a clear leader emerges.

Cakewalk aims to make experimentation second nature by giving teams the ability to go from idea to insight in minutes.
